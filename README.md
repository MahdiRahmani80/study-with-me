# What exists in this app?

1. Dagger2 -> used for dependency injection
2. Retrofit -> used for API handling with the PHP server
3. DataStore (Shared Preference) -> for saving some data like user data and the state of Pomodoro (is study, break, or long break)
4. MVVM -> This is an Android design pattern for reading more [this article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mvvm-model-view-viewmodel-architecture-pattern-in-android/)
5. Flover -> Using Flover to take some other build for different app stores (eg. [Myket](https://myket.ir/))
6. Compose -> This app is view-based, but implementing the Pomodoro timer is a little hard, so I decided to use Jitpck Compose for the timer.
7. Multi-Module -> For practice some of the app logic is in here, like user API services or shared preferences repositories
8. buildSrc -> Use this module for better-implementing dependencies between the modules.
9. Myket payment
10. My time and passion to make an app to everyone can gamify the reading, studying, and every boring stuff!
